GCP with free tier options

some guidelines we suggest. Python - FastAPI or Django or Flask Pytorch, Tensorflow libraries
and the models to be supported and hosted on AWS Bedrock or any chatbot frameworks
Frontend App - React or any other UI framework Database - mysql or mongodb or any other

Q: Are we required to track user-level conversation history & for how long?
A: Yes. User level conversation history is one of the primary data used for answering
contextually. Preferably advised to store 100% history anonymized. We shouldn’t be storing
user specific details. However, the details captured should be used for training the model
purposes.
